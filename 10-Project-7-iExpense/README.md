# Project 7 - iExpense

## Challenges

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Challenge | Status |
| --- | :---: |
| 1. Use the user’s preferred currency, rather than always using US dollars. | ✅ |
| 2. Modify the expense amounts in `ContentView` to contain some styling depending on their value – expenses under \$10 should have one style, expenses under \$100 another, and expenses over \$100 a third style. What those styles are depend on you. | ✅ |
| 3. For a bigger challenge, try splitting the expenses list into two sections: one for personal expenses, and one for business expenses. This is tricky for a few reasons, not least because it means being careful about how items are deleted! | ✅|
