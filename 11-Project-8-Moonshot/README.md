# Project 8 - Moonshot

## Challenges

<!-- prettier-ignore -->
| Challenge | Status |
| --- | :---: |
| 1. Add the launch date to `MissionView`, below the mission badge. You might choose to format this differently given that more space is available, but it’s down to you. | ✅ |
| 2. Extract one or two pieces of view code into their own new SwiftUI views – the horizontal scroll view in `MissionView` is a great candidate, but if you followed my styling then you could also move the `Rectangle` dividers out too. | ✅ |
| 3. For a tough challenge, add a toolbar item to `ContentView` that toggles between showing missions as a grid and as a list. | ✅ |
